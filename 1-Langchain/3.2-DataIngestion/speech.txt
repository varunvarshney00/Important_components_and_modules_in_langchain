people around joe bryant including his wife often felt that he was too focused on basketball that he talked about it constantly but his son kobes dedication made even joes passion seem small in comparison

when we talked about basketball we had a good relationship said rines who tried to connect with kobe as a young coach but how much can you talk about basketball his whole life was driven by the ball i could only talk to him for so long before i had to move on because there is only so much interest we could share

in his early years with the lakers when reporters asked kobe about his life outside of basketball he would simply reply basketball there is nothing else to people who were not driven to seek perfection in one pursuit that answer seemed extreme even unhealthy some close observers felt that in many ways kobe had no life beyond the game

this ties into a broader truth about self image often identity lags behind reality by a year or two a sudden change in status whether it is losing a lot of weight ending a long relationship signing a huge sports contract or achieving major business success can leave a gap between how the world sees you and how you see yourself your fears doubts and natural inclinations may remain the same yet everyone expects you to be this new elevated version of yourself

it takes time for your inner world to catch up with your outer reality in ancient times status changes were more gradual and limited in a small tribe there was not much room for dramatic rises or falls but today status can skyrocket in one area and plummet in another almost instantly human psychology is not built to handle that split between outward presentation and self image so quickly

eventually the two will come back together in the meantime it is worth trying to enjoy the ups and downs because before long you will not even remember what it felt like to be at the bottom
